The NY NOAA data was imported and studied.

In the original NOAA data set, there are total of 2,595,176 observations
from 747 different locations, ranging from year 1981 to 2020. Also,
there are 7 different variables as follows: `id` that corresponds to the
location, `date` that shows when the observation data was collected,
`snow` for snowfall amount, `snwd` for snow depth, `tmax` for maximum
temperature and `tmin` for minimum temperature.

Then, the data was cleaned and three additional variables for `year`,
`month`, and `date` were added. Any observation with missing data were
excluded for later analysis.

In addition, some of the variables were mutated so that they have
reasonable units. For instance, to ensure that all data for
precipitation, snowfall and snow depth are given in consistent unit of
mm, `prcp` values given in tenths of mm were adjusted. Similarly, to
ensure the temperature values are given in Celsius, both the `tmax` and
`tmin` values that were given in tenths of Celsius were changed. The
variable types for `tmax` and `tmin` were also changed to integer as
they were originally defined as characters.

The cleaned data was again checked and it was found that with missing
data removed, there were only 1,222,433 observations from 214 locations.

``` r
clean_ny_noaa |>
  drop_na() |>
  count(snow) |>
  filter(n == max(n)) |>
  pull(snow)
```

    ## [1] 0

The most commonly observed value is 0 for snowfall. It probably means
that there are more days that did not snow at all throughout the years,
which sounds reasonable considering that there are four different
seasons in New York.

A two-panel plot showing the average maximum temperature in January and
July for each station across the years is shown above. The average
maximum temperatures in July seem to be more consistent over the time
compared to the average maximum temperatures in January.

There is only one notable outlier that falls below the overall
distribution in July of late 1980s whereas there are several outstanding
outliers in both upper and lower area of the distribution in January
plot.

```

An accelerometer data collected in the NHANES study was loaded and
cleaned. Demographic data of the participants in the NHANES study was
also loaded and cleaned.

Some of the values of variables in the demographic data were changed to
more self-explanatory ones and variables with different levels were
changed to factor types. For instance, values for `sex` variable was
changed from 1 and 2 to male and female.

In addition, the two data sets were merged into one data frame and
participants who did not have full demographic data were excluded. Also,
only the participants who were 21 years or older were included in the
final data set `nhanes_data_df.`

``` r

A reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category was made. There were more participants in ‘more than
high school’ group than either of the ‘high school equivalent’ or ‘less
than high school’ group for both female and male.

``` r

Prior to creating a graph, the data was reformatted using
`pivot_longer`. Then, `group_by` and `summarize` function was used to
calculate the total_activity that sums up the accelerometer data
measured every minute throughout the day. Next, a visualization of the
age distributions for men and women in each education category was
created.

For education level ‘more than high school,’ there are more of the
younger participants who are under 40 than the older participants. The
distribution for both male and female are skewed to the right.

For ‘less than high school’ level, there are greater number of
participants who are over 40. The distribution is left skewed for both
male and female participants.

For ‘high school equivalent’ level, male distribution is bimodal whereas
female distribution is left-skewed.

``` r
nhanes_data_df |>
  group_by(seqn, sex, age, education) |>
  summarize(total_activity = sum(mims, na.rm = TRUE)) |>

  labs(
    title = "Age distribution of Accelerometer data of participants in different education levels",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total activity",
    caption = "NHANES data of participants who are greater than or equal to 21 years of age are taken from .csv file provided in P8105."
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'age'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.
    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw3_sy3269_files/figure-gfm/age_activities_plot-1.png" width="90%" />

The total activities of participants were plotted against their ages as
shown above.

According to the graph, higher total activity can be seen in the younger
participants in general, regardless of the education level. Also, the
regression line for both males and females in all three different
education levels have similar tendencies.

However, in ‘high school equivalent’ group, there is a female
participant around 30 who has a relatively low total-activity
observation compared to other females in her age and another female
participant around the same age with a notably high observation.

It can be also seen that in ‘high school equivalent’ and ‘more than high
school’ groups, females tend to have higher total activities than males
in all age groups.

However, for ‘less than high school’ group, only female participants who
are younger than 40 have higher total activity than males; for
participants over 40, higher total activity observations can be found in
males according to the regression line added with `geom_smooth`.

``` r
nhanes_data_df |>
  group_by(seqn, hour = rep(1:24, times = 228, each = 60), education, sex) |>
  summarize(mims_hr = sum(mims, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |>
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mims_hr, color = sex)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ education) + 
  labs(
    title = "Accelerometer data of participants participants in different education levels over a course of the day", 
    x = "Hour", 
    y = "MIMS for every hour", 
    caption = "NHANES data of participants who are greater than or equal to 21 years of age are taken from .csv file provided in P8105."
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_sy3269_files/figure-gfm/activity_time-1.png" width="90%" />

A three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each
education level with color code corresponding to sex is displayed above.

The regression line for all three education levels show similar
tendencies; the MIMS value starts to increase after 5 hours into the
study and stabilizes after 10 hours, then slowly decreases around 20
hours into the study.

The raw data for all three groups also show similar pattern, but there
are extreme outliers in ‘more than high school’ education level.

NYC Citi Bike data provided was imported and cleaned.

A reader friendly table showing the total number of rides separating
casual riders and Citi Bike members is made for all four combinations:
January 2020, July 2020, January 2024, and July 2024.

In all four combination of year and month, there were notably more
member rides than casual rides. Both member rides increased in 2024
compared to 2020 for both month January and July.

There tends to more rides in July than in January, possibly due to the
weather.

A plot showing the median duration of ride for every day of the week is
shown for the month of January and July, comparing 2020 and 2024 data
sets. It can be seen that for both January and July, the overall median
duration of ride decreased in 2024, compared to in 2020. The decrease in
July is especially notable compared to the one in January.

The longest median duration can be seen in July 2020 data, especially
during the weekends. However, the median duration of rides is not
significantly greater in the weekends for 2024 data.

For Citi Bike rides data of 2024, a figure that shows the impact of
month, membership status and bike type on the distribution of ride
duration is shown above.

For short distances in general, member riders tend to ride electric
bikes more than classic bikes compared to the casual riders. For
distances in January, the probability of casual riders riding electric
bikes was higher than that of classic bikes.

In January of 2024, the longest duration of ride using a classic bike
was greater than the longest duration of electric bike ride. However,
for July 2024 data, the longest duration of rides for both electric and
classic bike was not significantly different they were all greater than
200 minutes.
