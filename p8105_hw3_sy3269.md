The NY NOAA data is imported and studied. There are total of 2595176
observations from 747 different locations in this data set, and there
are 7 different variables. The variables are `id` that corresponds to
location, `date` that shows when the observation data was collected,
`snow`, `snwd`, `tmax` and `tmin`. The NY NOAA data ranges from 1981 to
2020. Depending on the id, the number of available observations differ.
It can be seen that there are a lot missing data in this data set. For
instance, there are 1157 observations for id `US1NYAB0001`, whereas
there are only 214 observations available for id `US1NYAB0016` for the
same period of time.

The imported NY NOAA data was cleaned and separate variables for year,
month, and day were created. The variable units for temperature,
precipitation and snowfall data were checked and it was noticed that the
temperature data is weird. We cannot have -223 degrees Fahrenheit,
Celsius or Kelvin.

## Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are given in reasonable units.

Also, the variable types for `tmax` and `tmin` were changed to integer
as they were originally defined as characters.

For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?

``` r
ny_noaa_df |>
  filter(month == 1 | month == 7) |>
  mutate(avg_tmax = mean(tmax)) |>
  drop_na() |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_tmax, color = id)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  labs(
    title = "Average maximum temperature scatterplot",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Maximum Temp (C)",
    color = "Location",
    caption = "Weather data taken from p8105 ny_noaa datasets."
    )
```

Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and
in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
interpretable structure? Any outliers?

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.

An accelerometer data collected in the NHANES study was loaded and
cleaned. Demographic data of the participants in the NHANES study was
also loaded and cleaned. Some of the variables in the demographic data
were changed to more self-explanatory value and the type was set as
factor. The two data sets were merged into one data frame and
participants who did not have full demographic data were excluded and
only the participants who were 21 years or older were included.

NYC Citi Bike data provided was imported and cleaned. Then, a
reader-friendly table showing the total number of rides separating
casual riders and Citi Bike members is made for each combination of year
and month. For January 2020, there were 984 casual rides and 11436
member rides. For July 2020, there were 2108 casual rides and 16753
member rides. For January 2024, there were 5637 casual rides and 15411
member rides. For July 2024, there were 10894 casual rides and 36262
member rides.

In all four combination of year and month, there were notably more
member rides than casual rides.
